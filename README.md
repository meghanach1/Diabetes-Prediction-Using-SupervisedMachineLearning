# DiabetesPredictionUsingSupervisedMachineLearning
Diabetes prediction using multiple machine learning algorithms to choose
the best performing model on the given data. To implement this,I've used a dataset which is
publicly available in the Kaggle or will be considering Pima Indian diabetes database. In this
dataset there are  multiple features like pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure, insulin level, body
mass index and Age.
With this data, I have implemented multiple machine learning algorithms to classify
whether a person could be affected by diabetes or not.

# Plan of Execution:
During this process,we will implement a number of different supervised machine learning
techniques. Some of these algorithms include K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Baye, Decision Tree
Classifier, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
It begins with labeling the input data, followed by separating the data into training and testing
sets to train and test how the models are behaving with respect to various types of data. This
ensures that the algorithms are aware of the types of data that are associated with each feature.
To assess the performance of the model, we will use the validation metrics. In this scenario, the
real-time data ought to be included in the same label dataset. If the new kind of datasets do not
include labels, we will be able to utilize unsupervised models to automatically determine which
label the data should be assigned to, and the prediction will be consistent with the models that we
have constructed. However, given the limited access to hardware and software as well as the

time constraints, we have decided to stick to supervised models for this endeavor. Ultimately, we
will be able to calculate the likelihood of acquiring diabetes, which will help save lives.
